    "en": "The South African Revenue Service (SARS) is South Africaâ€™s tax collecting authority. They are responsible for the following main tax types: Personal Income Tax, Corporate Income Tax (CIT), Value Added Tax (VAT), Pay As Your Earn (PAYE) [1]. A full list of different tax types can be found on the referenced website.\n\nThis registrar covers individuals as well as businesses such as public and private companies, co-operatives, universities, trusts, governments and embassies.\n\nIndividuals receive a unique Income Tax Number. Org-id does not recommend using the Income Tax Number of an individual person as a unique identifier.\n\nBusinesses can receive multiple tax numbers such as CIT, VAT, PAYE etc. [3] The Corporate Income Tax (CIT) is a tax imposed on companies resident in the Republic of South Africa and this is the preferred identifier to be used for a business.\n\n[1]. https://www.sars.gov.za/types-of-tax/ \n[2]. https://www.sars.gov.za/businesses-and-employers/\n[3]. https://www.sars.gov.za/businesses-and-employers/"
