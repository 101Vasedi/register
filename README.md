# org-id.guide: register

This repository holds the sources for the http://org-id.guide register of organisation lists. 

Visit http://org-id.guide to access an aggregated copy of the list.

## Current status (as of 6th April 2020)

We (Open Data Services Co-operative) are not currently adding new, unsolicited entries to org-id while we focus our efforts on improving the service. (Those improvements will take longer than initially planned because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.) Some open data standards have made arrangements to add fully-researched org-id entries. Requests from those organisations will be dealt with under those arrangements.

We have spoken with and consulted those open data standards and organisations who we know use org-id. If you would like to be involved in the re-development of this service you can contact us at contact@org-id.guide. Weâ€™d love to hear from you.
