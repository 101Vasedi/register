## NOTE

As of 18th Dec 2019, we (Open Data Service Co-operative) are not currently adding new, unsolicited entries to org-id while we focus our efforts on improving the service. Some open data standards have made arrangements to add fully researched org-id entries. Requests from those organisations will be dealt with under those arrangements; please make sure you mention the open data standard related to your request or proposal (e.g. 'OCDS', '360Giving', 'BODS' etc.). See the root README.md for more information.
